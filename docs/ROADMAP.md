## Known Technical Challenges

1. **Battery & Performance Impact**: Monitoring calendar events in the background could impact device battery life and performance. This will require optimization.

2. **OAuth Permissions**: Getting users to grant calendar access permissions may face resistance. Detailed explanations and privacy policies will be necessary.

3. **Chrome Platform Limitations**: Chrome extensions have certain limitations in how they can interact with the browser. We may need to implement creative solutions for full-screen overlays.

4. **Google Calendar API Rate Limits**: We must ensure our polling mechanism respects Google's rate limits and uses smart caching.

5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems and Chrome versions will require extensive testing.
